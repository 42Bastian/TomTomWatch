## Introduction
Tool for exporting GPS files from TomTom Sports Watches

Homepage: http://blog.studioblueplanet.net/?page_id=566

TomTomWatch is a tool for downloading GPS tracks from the TomTom Sports watches. It downloads the ttbin files and extracts the raw GPS data.
I also offers track smoothing, when enabled.

It contains a lot of features for maintaining the watch, like
For the more technical users it contains a Debugging menu that offers functions for file manipulation, resetting, rebooting, etc.

The software will be tested primarily on Windows. On request it can be tested on Linux (Centos). Though the USB4Java lib that is being used should support it, the software will *not* be tested on OS-X.

## Disclaimer
**Though I have used the software myself for years and I have tested it thorougly, usage might damage your watch. The software was created without help or specifications of TomTom, so it may contain unforseen issues. This particularly holds for the features under the 'Debugging' menu, which should be regaded as experimental.**

When encountering problems don't forget to read the FAQ below.

## Building
It uses Maven for building. Use a development environment like Netbeans or Eclipse.

### Notes
- Be sure javac and mvn are in the PATH and JAVA_HOME is set
- Build `mvn -Dmaven.test.skip package`

## Configuring
After building the target directory contains tomtomwatch.properties. In Netbeans you can use this file in the TomTomWatch root directory
during development and debugging.
The file is self-explanatory

## Disclaimer
Use the software at own risk. If not used properly, especially the debugging features, I guess it might brick your watch
(though it never happened to me so far...).

## FAQ

### When I choose 'Activity summary' I see my tracks, but I cannot download them
If you cannot download tracks, then there are no **track files** on the watch.
They get downloaded _and deleted_ when you connnected to TomTom MySports. The 'Activity Summary' shows the last 10 logged activities from the history files. 'Activity History' shows a summary of logged activities from summary files.
To check: 
1. Go outside
2. Log an activity
3. Connect watch tot TomTomWatch and press 'Download': the track should be downloaded

### My watch gets slow
When you log more and more activities, the watch appears to start responding slowly when starting a new activity. 
Erasing the track files by pressing the 'Erase' button solves the problem. This erases the track files.
Unlike TomTom MySports, TomTomWatch does not automatically erase all tracks when downloaded. You have to do it manually.

### Upload Workout from JSON is greyed out
Upload Workouts from JSON is only supported for a number of types of TomTom watches: it is only supported for watches that I have tested.
Note that it is an _experimental_ feature. Therefore it is under the debugging menu. I can imagine you might damage your watch when you've errors in the JSON.
