# TomTomWatch

## Introduction
Tool for exporting GPS files from TomTom Sports Watches

Homepage: http://blog.studioblueplanet.net/?page_id=566

TomTomWatch is a tool for downloading GPS tracks from the TomTom Sports watches. It downloads the ttbin files and extracts the raw GPS data.
I also offers track smoothing, when enabled.

It contains a lot of features for maintaining the watch, like
For the more technical users it contains a Debugging menu that offers functions for file manipulation, resetting, rebooting, etc.

The software will be tested primarily on Windows. On request it can be tested on Linux (Centos). Though the USB4Java lib that is being used should support it, the software will *not* be tested on OS-X.

## Building
It uses Maven for building. Use a development environment like Netbeans or Eclipse.

### Notes
- Be sure javac and mvn are in the PATH and JAVA_HOME is set
- Build `mvn -Dmaven.test.skip package`

## Configuring
After building the target directory contains tomtomwatch.properties. In Netbeans you can use this file in the TomTomWatch root directory
during development and debugging.
The file is self-explanatory

## Disclaimer
Use the software at own risk. If not used properly, especially the debugging features, I guess it might brick your watch
(though it never happened to me so far...).
